## Development

### What's in it?
* Simple src/index.jsx and src/index.css (local module css).
* Webpack configuration for development (with hot reloading) and production (with minification).
* CSS module loading, so you can include your css by ```import styles from './path/to.css';```.
* Both js(x) and css hot loaded during development.
* [Webpack Dashboard Plugin](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/webpack-dashboard) on dev server.
